# Chapter 1

This is chapter 1. 

## Images convention

For any chapter file, use direct relative path as below. The converter script will rebase the root folder accordingly during conversion. So you can still preview with proper relative folder here, and at same time, get the link corrected during conversion to latex such that, latex also has image properly referenced.
